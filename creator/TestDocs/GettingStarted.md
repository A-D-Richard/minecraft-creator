### Behavior, Skin, And Resource Packs

There are 3 folders called **behavior_packs**, **resource_packs**, and **skin_packs**. These folders contain folders for each of their respective type of packs. Any custom content that will be added to minecraft will come in the form of one of these 3 packs.

### Development Packs

Along with the 3 pack folders, there are also Development version of those folders. Development packs are packs that are updated every time Minecraft is launched, allowing Creators to quickly load and test changes they have made to their packs.

### minecraftWorlds

**minecraftWorlds** contains each world that has been generated within the current build of Minecraft. Each folder will also contain resource and behavior pack folders to contain any packs that may be connected with the level.

It's recommended that when installing a new build of Minecraft, Users back up this folder in order to prevent any potential loss of Minecraft Worlds that users may have.

## Visual Studio Code

Integrated Development Environment, or IDE is a piece of software that provides the fundamental tools of computer programming within one program. This type of software usually includes a code editor, a compiler, a debugger, and a graphical user interface builder.

In this tutorial, you will learn about Visual Studio Code, a free and open sourced IDE provided by Microsoft. VSCode allows users to quickly craft and edit many different type of files, including JSON files used in Minecraft Add-on development.
