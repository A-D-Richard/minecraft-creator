# Introduction to Functions

Function files can be used to group together multiple commands. This makes it easier to run multiple commands at once by executing the function through the chat box.

>[!Tip]
> Minecraft **cannot** run more than 10,000 commands in one function file. This includes function commands being executed by the original function. Not that we recommend running that many commands in one go, because that would affect the game's performance. 

In this tutorial you will learn the following:

### Requirements

Itâ€™s recommended that the following be completed before beginning this tutorial:

- [Introduction To Behavior Packs](BehaviorPack.md)
- [Introduction to Commands](CommandsIntroduction.md)

You will also need the following:

- Your own behavior pack folder that already contains a `manifest.json` file.
- A Minecraft world with cheats enabled.

## Setting up the Functions Folder

Function files have a .mcfunction extension and they live in the **functions** folder of your behavior pack. 

1. Start by creating a folder inside your behavior pack and name it **functions**. This folder should be on the same level as your `manifest.json` file.
1. Open the **functions** folder and create a text file.
1. Name the file **ouch.mcfunction**.
1. Open the file, then copy and paste the following code into it:

    ```json
    say Bye...
    teleport @s ~10 ~10 ~10 true
    say OUCH!
    ```
1. Save the file.

Don't start the commands with `/`. 

## Testing the function

1. Launch Minecraft.
2. Open w world with cheats enabled and the bahavior -pack you created applied to it.
3. Enter `/function ouch`.

## Advanced function feature

You can place functions inside directories to organize them and to avoid conflicts with functions in other behavior packs.

So, if you have another folder inside your **functions** folder called **init** and you put 'ouch.mcfunction` in there, you would run it like this:
`/function init/ouch`
