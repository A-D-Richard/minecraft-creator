# Introduction to Functions

While commands in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition allow creators to add logic and gameplay features to their Add-Ons, commands require a user to either manually enter commands arguments or set up elaborate chains of command blocks to execute properly. However, with function files, you can group together multiple commands into a single file allowing you to run a series of commands with a single execute. With functions, you can set up ways to generate buildings and structures around a select player, set up a reward system to gift items to a player, or teleport players to relative locations.

>[!Tip]
> Minecraft **cannot** run more than 10,000 commands in one function file. This includes function commands being executed by the original function. Not that we recommend running that many commands in one go, because that would affect the game's performance.

In this tutorial you will learn the following:

### Requirements

Itâ€™s recommended that the following be completed before beginning this tutorial:

- [Introduction To Behavior Packs](BehaviorPack.md)
- [Introduction to Commands](CommandsIntroduction.md)

You will also need the following:

- Your own behavior pack folder that already contains a `manifest.json` file.
- A Minecraft world with cheats enabled.

## Setting up the Functions Folder

Function files have a .mcfunction extension and they live in the **functions** folder of your behavior pack.

1. Start by creating a folder inside your behavior pack and name it **functions**. This folder should be on the same level as your `manifest.json` file.
1. Open the **functions** folder and create a text file.
1. Name the file **ouch.mcfunction**.
1. Open the file, then copy and paste the following code into it:

    ```json
    say Bye...
    teleport @s ~10 ~10 ~10 true
    say OUCH!
    ```

1. Save the file.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> When working with commands in a .mcfunction file, you do not need to start commands with `/`.

## Testing the function

1. Launch Minecraft.
2. Open a world with cheats enabled and the behavior pack you created applied to it.
3. Enter `/function ouch`.

## Advanced function feature

You can place functions inside directories to organize them and to avoid conflicts with functions in other behavior packs.

For example, if you have another folder inside your functions folder called **init** and you put `ouch.mcfunction` in there, you would run it like this:
`/function init/ouch`

## What's Next?

Now that you have an overview of how a function file works, you can learn how to utilize the in-game tick function and tick.json file in order to fire off custom functions on repeat.
