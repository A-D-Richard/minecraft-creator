# Ray Tracing - Getting Started

Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for Windows 10/11 has been upgraded with cutting-edge path-traced ray tracing, enabling gamers and world builders to craft incredible new sights and immersive environments. To take full advantage of the new possibilities ray tracing introduced in the free 1.16.200 update for Minecraft, physically-based textures have also been introduced, featuring extra surface detail, the ability to emit light, and more. To further enhance the visual experience of RTX, creators can also define their own settings for fog via resource packs.

## Overview

### Part 1 - What is Ray Tracing

Ray Tracing is a series of computer rendering techniques that bring more realistic lighting to scenes. In this section, you will learn more about the different types of Ray Tracing techniques used by Minecraft and also go over some of the more commonly asked questions.

### Part 2 - Physically Based Texturing Guide - Introduction

You will learn about each new texture map Creators can use to build and design photorealistic materials and lighting effects, and you will learn how to use texture maps to create a mirror in-game.

> [Physically Based Texturing Guide - Introduction](Documents/RTX_PBRTexturingGuide_Intro.md)

### Part 3 - Physically Based Texturing Guide - Workflow

In this part, you will learn how to create physically-based textures by creating a series of texture maps for your own texture set for use on the Redstone block.

### Part 4 - Fog in Resources

Along with Ray Tracing, fog in Minecraft has been updated to use a similar JSON structure that allows you to create and control its in-game appearance.
