# Creations Hub

As a creator, everything you put into Minecraft: Bedrock Edition is by default a creation: From the creatures and characters your players will meet to the very game world in which they are playing, creations are the main attraction of the player experience.

Such an important aspect requires some guidance, which is where this page comes in! The creations hub is here to provide a helping hand to creators of all levels as they progress.

Here are some articles you should check out to assist in your creator journey... rest assured, there's information in these articles for creators of all levels, but in the nature of the game, we're going to sort things by difficulty level.

## Basic

Let's not get things twisted here: 'basic' in this context is relative, and while these creations aren't as robust is what we'll be looking at later, they cover some integral technical content such as behavior packs, resource packs, and commands.

- [Create an In-World Game with Commands](CreateAnInWorldGame.md)
- [Create Custom Grass Blocks: An Introduction to Resource Packs](ResourcePack.md)
- [Create an Angry Cow: An Introduction to Behavior Packs](BehaviorPack.md)

## Intermediate

You've mastered the basics, and now it's time to move to the next level. These creations are slightly more complex, but will allow you to create more of a personalized experience for your players.

- [Creating a Goblin Chef Entity](MakerSeriesMakingTheGoblinChef.md)
- [Creating and Adding Custom Sounds](AddCustomSounds.md)

## Advanced

Now that you've pushed through both the basic and intermediate creations, you've come to the top of the mountain. These are the advanced-level tutorials and we're not going to lie, they can get complex. However, by mastering these creations you will bring yourself that much closer to making your wildest dreams into reality.

The good news is that you now have an incredible set of skills at your disposal to make custom content and provide players with something unique and fun. The better news is that this is just a small sample of what you can find on the learning portal.
