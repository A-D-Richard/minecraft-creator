# Overview of a Mash-up Pack

Mash-ups are pre-built worlds that come with a resource pack and a skin pack. The resource pack is automatically applied to the mash-up world and can be added to any other world that you want to enhance.

Creators should consider making the mash-up into a template, so creators can create new worlds from the beginning (which is a lot of the fun of mash-ups) as opposed to having to re-import the world every time.
