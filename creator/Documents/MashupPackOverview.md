# Overview of a Mashup Pack

Mashup packs are the most complex type of content partners can create. Mashups include a world, a skin pack, and a texture pack. Each element of a mashup pack is subject to all guidelines for each different type of content.

Mashup texture packs must be a complete overhaul. Mashups must also include a full skin pack with the same number and guideline requirements as standalone skin packs.

Mashups are occasionally featured on the Marketplace homepage and can be located within the Mashup Packs category.
