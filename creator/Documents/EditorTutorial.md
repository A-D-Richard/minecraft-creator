## Village Building in a Greenhouse

In this tutorial, we are going to select a building from a village and put it into nice, safe glass structure.

1. Launch Editor and create a new project with seed: `2123293805289839865`. You don't have to use this seed, but you spawn within sight of a village with a nice variety of buildings and not too many trees - which is what we want for this project..
1. Close the Welcome screen if it is open.
1. Go to the World Options menu and turn the Daylight cycle off.
1. Navigate over to the village near coordinates (-161, 68, 171). Hint: try using the grapple teleport (`Ctrl G`) to get over there.
1. Use the Selection tool to select an entire building and some of the ground around it. Hint: If you don't have a favorite Selection mode yet, try using Freeform to select the ground first and then use the resize gizmos to make the selection big enough. The selection should be at least 3 blocks larger than the building.
1. Make a note of the Origin and Size coordinates.
1. Cut (`Ctrl X`) the selection.
1. Use the selection gizmos to make the selection at least 3 blocks larger on the sides and top.
1. On the Selection tool screen, in the Fill Selection section, change the Block Type to **glass**.
1. Use the selection gizmos to draw the selection a one block smaller on the sides and top.
1. Change the Selection tool Block Type to air and Fill Selection.
1. Paste in the selected building.
