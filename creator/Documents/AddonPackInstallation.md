# Installing Add-Ons to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition

Add-Ons give you the ability to change the way things in your game look and behave; Add-Ons help you bring new gameplay ideas to life. They are the first step in your journey towards a fully customizable Minecraft.

## Sample Add-On Projects

In addition to our Vanilla Resource and Behavior Packs, two sample Add-Ons are available for download: one was created by our devs here at Team Minecraft, and one was created by community members SethBling, BlockWorks and the Mindcrack crew.
