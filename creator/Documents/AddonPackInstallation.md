# Installing Add-Ons in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition

Add-Ons give you the ability to change the way things in your game look and behave. Add-Ons help you bring new gameplay ideas to life. They are the first step in your journey towards a fully customizable Minecraft.

## Installing Add-On Instructions

Add-Ons can be installed on a variety of platforms running Minecraft. These tabs explain how to install Add-Ons for each device.

# [Windows 10](#tab/Windows10)

1. Open Minecraft for Windows 10.
1. Download the world or Add-On file from the provided source (URL, email attachment, etc.). If the file downloads as a .zip file, change the file extension name to ".mcworld" or ".mcpack".
1. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the file.
1. Open the file and the Add-On should open in Minecraft.

- If you're opening a .mcworld that contains Add-Ons, the game will notify you that you've successfully imported the world. It will then be available from the "Play" menu.
- If you're opening a .mcpack, a pop-up notification will alert you that you've successfully imported the pack. Depending on the pack type, this will then be available when editing worlds in either the Behavior Pack Tab or Resource Pack Tab.

# [Realms](#tab/Realms)

To install a world onto a Minecraft Realm, you will need a Windows PC with Minecraft installed on it and a Realms subscription. After the world is on your Realm, players can connect to it using devices such as an Xbox Console or Windows 10 computer.

1. Download the world to your Windows 10 computer.
1. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the file.
1. Open the file to open the world in Minecraft on your Windows 10 computer.
1. Save and close the game to go back to the window in Minecraft that displays your existing worlds and Realms.
1. Open the edit screen for your Realm.
1. Replace the current world in your Realm with the downloaded world. It may take a while for the world to upload to your Realm.
1. Play in the Realm.

This process covers how to activate resource packs and behavior packs in a world on your Minecraft Realm.

1. On your Windows 10 computer, if Minecraft is running, close it down.
1. Find the com.mojang folder on your computer. ([Getting Started](GettingStarted.md) has instructions about how to do that, if you need them.)
1. To install a resource pack onto a Realm, copy the resource pack into the **resource_packs** folder in the com.mojang folder on your Windows 10 computer.
1. To install a behavior pack onto a Realm, copy the behavior pack into the **behavior_packs** folder in the com.mojang folder on your Windows 10 computer.
    >[!IMPORTANT]
    > Be sure to put the behavior pack in the **behavior packs** folder and **not** the **development_behavior_packs** folder in com.mojang. Otherwise, your behavior packs won't show up.
1. Launch Minecraft and open the **Edit World** screen for your Realm.
1. In the Add-Ons section of the screen, activate the resource pack and behavior pack.
1. Play in the Realm with any device that can connect to it, such as an Xbox Console or Windows 10 computer.

# [Android](#tab/android)

1. Launch Minecraft.
1. Download the world or Add-On file to your Android device.
1. Go to the Settings app and select Storage > Explore (at the bottom). If you do not have a settings app, you can install a file explorer app like ES File Explorer.
1. Select the directory where you saved the file, usually "Download".
1. Select the file and the Add-On should open in Minecraft.

- If you're opening a .mcworld that contains Add-Ons, the game will notify you that you've successfully imported the world. It will then be available from the "Play" menu.
- If you're opening a .mcpack, a pop-up notification will alert you that you've successfully imported the pack. Depending on the pack type, this will then be available when editing worlds in either the Behavior Pack Tab or Resource Pack Tab.

# [iOS](#tab/iOS)

1. Launch Minecraft.
1. Click on the world or Add-On file you want to open (URL, e-mail attachment, etc.).
1. Your device will prompt you to open the file with Minecraft.
1. Click Open in "Minecraft". This will launch Minecraft with your selected file.

- If you're opening a .mcworld that contains Add-Ons, the game will notify you that you've successfully imported the world. It will then be available from the "Play" menu.
- If you're opening a .mcpack, a pop-up notification will alert you that you've successfully imported the pack. Depending on the pack type, this will then be available when editing worlds in either the Behavior Pack Tab or Resource Pack Tab.

# [Oculus Rift](#tab/oculusrift)

1. Open Minecraft for Windows 10 in Rift Mode (if not in Rift mode, Add-Ons will open the regular version of Minecraft for Windows 10).
1. Download the world or Add-On file from the provided source (URL, email attachment, etc.). If the file downloads as a .zip file, change the file extension name to ".mcworld" or ".mcpack".
1. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the file.
1. Open the file & the Add-On should open in Minecraft.

- If you're opening a .mcworld that contains Add-Ons, the game will notify you that you've successfully imported the world. It will then be available from the "Play" menu.
