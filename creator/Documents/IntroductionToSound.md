# Introduction to Sounds

Welcome to the world of sound! In this introduction, we will go over the very basics of sounds in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. Note that this is in no way intended to be an all-encompassing or in-depth examination, and is more of the first step on a long path.

Sounds in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition work, in the broadest of terms, by playing audio files that are stored in the file structure of the game. These files are played in response to in-game events such as player actions, environmental changes, and the actions of other players.

The playback volume of sounds can be adjusted using in-game settings, while sounds can be further edited or replaced completely with resource packs.

## Sound Hierarchy

Sounds in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition are identified in multiple ways:

- **Sounds:** These are the individual sound files that constitute everything a player hears in-game.
- **Sound Events:** Sound events are exactly what they say they are... In-game events that involve one or more sounds. Multiple sound events can contain the same sound; for example, both the 'mob.drowned.sim' and 'random.swim' sound events contain the 'sounds/random/swim1' sound.
- **Sound Categories:** Once again, this is fairly self-explanatory... Sound categories are broad fields into which sounds are organized, and can then be further organized in a chain. For example, the 'Weather' category contains sounds such as 'Thunder1' and 'Rain3.' In turn, 'Weather' is a child category of the broader 'Ambient' designation.
