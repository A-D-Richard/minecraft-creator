# Introduction to Sounds

Sounds in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition work by playing audio files that are stored in the file structure of the game. These files are played in response to in-game events such as player actions, environmental changes, and the actions of other players.

The volume any playback of sounds can be adjusted via in-game settings, while sounds can be further edited or replaced completely via resource packs. 

## Sound Hierarchy

Sounds are identified in multiple ways in Minecraft:

- **Sounds:** These are the individual sound files that constitute all of the audio elements in the game. 
- **Sound Events:** Sound events are exactly what they say they are... In-game events that involve one or more sounds. Multiple sound events can contain the same sound; for example, both the **X** and **Y** sound events contain the **Z** sound.
- **Sound Categories:** Once again, this is fairly self-explanatory... Sound categories are broad fields into which sounds are organized. For example, the 'Weather' category contains sounds such as 'Thunder1' and 'Rain3.' In turn, 'Weather' is a child category of the broader 'Ambient' designation.
