# Getting Started with Add-On Development for Bedrock Edition

Add-Ons are the first step on our journey towards bringing even greater levels of customization to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. Add-Ons allow players to transform the look of their worlds and even change the behavior of mobs. For example, you can change the blast radius of a creeper or the texture itâ€™s wearing.

In this tutorial, you will learn the following.

>[!div class="checklist"]
> - The File Structure used for Minecraft
> - Software is used for editing JSON files.
> - Extensions that are available to help with Add-On development.

## com.mojang

When Minecraft is installed to your computer, there is a folder directory called **com.mojang** that is generated in the AppData folder. To access this folder, you can use the following solution to locate within Windows 10 OS.

In order to locate the **com.mojang** folder in Windows, You will need to have **Hidden items** set to **true** by selecting the **Checkbox** as shown below.

To enable **View Hidden Items**

1. Open **File Explorer** from the taskbar.
1. Select **View** > **Options** > **Change folder and search options**.
1. Select the **View** tab and, in **Advanced settings**, select **Show hidden files, folders, and drives** and **OK**.

### Locating com.mojang

1. Press **Win+R** to open **Run**. Alternatively, you can launch **Run** in the start menu.
1. Copy and paste the following: `%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang`
1. Press **OK**.

As shown in the image below, there are multiple subdirectories located within the com.mojang folder.

> [!TIP]
> If you see more content in this folder than what is shown above, do not panic! This image shows a fresh install of Minecraft.

### Behavior, Skin, and Resource Packs

There are 3 folders called **behavior_packs**, **resource_packs**, and **skin_packs**. Any custom content that will be added to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition will come in the form of one of these 3 packs.

### Development Packs

Along with the 3 pack folders, there are also development versions of those folders. Development packs are packs that are updated every time Minecraft is launched, allowing you to quickly load and test changes they have made to their packs.

### minecraftWorlds

**minecraftWorlds** contains each world that has been generated within the current build of Minecraft. Each folder will also contain resource and behavior pack folders to contain any packs that may be in use within the world.
> [!TIP]
> It's recommended that when installing a new build of Minecraft, you should save a copy of this folder to use as a back up in order to prevent any potential loss of Minecraft Worlds that you may have.

## Visual Studio Code

JSON is a popular text file format that is used by Minecraft Bedrock Edition in order to interact with content within. JSON can be edited in any text editor such as Notepad or Word. However, Visual Studio Code is a free to use text based editor that supports 3rd party extensions, including some built for Bedrock development.

### Installing Visual Studio Code

1. Follow the link here to [Install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

## Visual Studio Code Extensions

Visual Studio Code supports extensions created by the Visual Studio Code developer community. Extensions are a great way to help write and understand Minecraft syntax when working on resource and behavior packs.

### Installing Extensions

1. Click on the link provided to download [Bedrock Definitions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=destruc7i0n.vscode-bedrock-definitions) for Visual Studio Code.
1. Click on the link provided to download [Blockception's Minecraft Bedrock Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BlockceptionLtd.blockceptionvscodeminecraftbedrockdevelopmentextension) for Visual Studio Code.

### What's Next?

Now that your development environment is set up, you can start creating your first Add-On by learning more about resource packs.
