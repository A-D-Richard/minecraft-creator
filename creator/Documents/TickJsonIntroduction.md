# Introduction to tick.json

While command blocks are great for running a series of commands based on in-game events, Minecraft: Bedrock Edition offers the ability to use the in-game tick function to repeatedly run a series of functions by using a file called **tick.json**. Tick.json is stored in the **functions** folder of a behavior pack next to the files containing the functions you want to run.

>[!Note]
>Tick.json uses the gameplay tick which is 20 ticks per second, as opposed to the redstone tick which is 10 ticks per second. In other words, the functions you set up to run in tick.json will be executed 20 times every second of gameplay.

>[!Important]
> Using tick.json is valuable when you're trying to stay away from using repeating command blocks in-game, it's known for executing functions before the world has fully loaded in. This might cause unintended behavior if you do not plan function usage carefully.
> Also, including a lot of commands to be run every tick of the game will severely affect performance, especially in low-end devices.

In this tutorial you will learn the following:

### Requirements

Itâ€™s recommended that the following be completed before beginning this tutorial:

- [Introduction To Behavior Packs](BehaviorPack.md)
- [Introduction to Commands](CommandsIntroduction.md)
- [Introduction to Functions](FunctionsIntroduction.md)

You will also need the following:

- Your own behavior pack folder that already contains a `manifest.json` file.
- A Minecraft world with cheats enabled.

## Setting up the Functions Folder

The **tick.json** file contains the names of functions that you want to run every tick. Before creating tick.json, you will need to have functions for it to run. This example creates two function files to demonstrate how tick.json calls the files repeatedly.

1. If you don't already have one create a folder inside your behavior pack and name it **functions**. This folder should be on the same level as your `manifest.json` file.
1. Open the **functions** folder and create a text file.
1. Name the file **function_say_one.mcfunction**.
1. Open the file and enter `say one` on the first line.
1. Save the file.
1. Create another function file and name it **function_say_two.mcfunction**.
1. Open the file and enter `say two` on the first line.
1. Save the file.

Now there are two files for tick.json to call.

## Creating tick.json

The tick.json file contains a list of the functions that you want to execute on every tick of the game. You can also set the order that the functions will be called.

1. Inside the **functions** folder, create a text file and name it **tick.json**.
1. Copy the following text and paste it into your **tick.json** file. Save the file.

  ```json
   {
      "values": [
          "function_say_one", "function_say_two"
      ]
    }
 ```

The tick.json file uses only the `values` key, and the values are the names of the functions to run, without the .mcfunction extension.

## Testing the file

Launch Minecraft and activate the behavior pack.
When the world loads, there will be repeated messages displayed on the screen from **[Server]**.

>[!Note]
> Function files are additive and multiple will run if they exist in multiple behavior packs. For example, if the behavior pack stack has multiple behavior packs, all functions in tick.json will be run every tick.
