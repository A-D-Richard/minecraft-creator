## How do I activate an Experimental Features toggle for my world?

You can activate an experimental toggle for any new world you create and for existing worlds.

> [!WARNING]
> Activating experimental features that are still under development means that your world might crash, break, or not work with future updates.

If you're planning to build content that you want to share with the community, it would be best to do it in a non-experimental world.

### Toggle Experimental Features in a New World

If you are building a new world from scratch to test experimental features, you can toggle which features you want enabled in the **Game** Settings.

1. Under **Game** settings, navigate down to **Experiments** and select a toggle to enable the feature.

### Toggle Experimental Features in an Existing World

If you want to add experimental features to an existing world, you can edit the game settings to similarly to the steps taken when adding experimental features in a new world.

> [!NOTE]
> While a copy of your world is generated automatically when activating an experimental feature toggle, in the event of something going wrong, you're also able to create copies of your world manually as an extra precaution.

1. Select the world you want to add experimental features to and select the **Edit** button.

### Verify that the World has Experimental Features Enabled

Once you’ve created a world that has an experimental feature toggle enabled, your world will get a **tag** next to the game mode in your Worlds list that says **Experimental**.

Another way to identify if your world is using experimental toggles is to visit the settings for your world. On the **Game** world settings, scroll down to the **Experiments** section to see which experiments are enabled.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Worlds that use the experimental features toggle cannot be restored to a non-experimental state.
