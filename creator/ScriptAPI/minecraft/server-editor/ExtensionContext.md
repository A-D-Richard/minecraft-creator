# ExtensionContext Class

The extension context is a native (C++) object created for each registered Editor Extension, when a player connection is established with the server.  

A registered extension activation or deactivation closure is accompanied by an [ExtensionContext] object, which provides a player specific, editor extension specific context.

The Extension Context is the main interface to all the bound Editor Services.

As more player services are added to the editor, they will be exposed through this object
