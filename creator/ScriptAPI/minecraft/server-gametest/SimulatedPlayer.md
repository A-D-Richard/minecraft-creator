# SimulatedPlayer Class

## Extends
- [*@minecraft/server.Player*](../../minecraft/server/Player.md)

A simulated player can be used within GameTests to represent how a player moves throughout the world and to support testing of how entities and the environment will react to a player. This type derives much of its structure and methods from the [*@minecraft/server.Player*](../../minecraft/server/Player.md) type. Note that many types of events that may be available for entities more broadly, such as item use events, may not fire in the same capacity for simulated players.

## Properties
