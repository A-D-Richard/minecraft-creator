# Change Your Realm World 

You can change the world you want to play on your Realm any time. Keep in mind that if you change your Realm world, all of the progress and changes you have made to that world will be lost. If you would like to save your progress in this world, we recommend downloading it before replacing it with a different world. Any friends you have invited to your Realm will still be able to play on your new Realm world. 

## Download Your Current Realm World

To download your current Realm world, follow these instructions:

1. In Minecraft, select **Play**.
2. Select the **Edit** button next to your Realm world.
3. Choose **Download World**.
4. When the download is complete, choose **Let's Go!**

Your Realm world will now appear in your world list. You can play on this world offline and continue to make progress.

## Replace Your Realm World

To replace your Realm world, follow these instructions:

1. In Minecraft, select **Play**.
2. Select the **Edit** button next to your Realm world.
3. Select **Replace World** and choose **Confirm**.
4. When the replacement is finished, choose **Let's Go!**

Your Realm world will now be replaced with your chosen world. You can invite friends to play with you, edit world settings, and play on your new Realm world.
