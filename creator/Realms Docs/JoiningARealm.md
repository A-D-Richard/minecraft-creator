# Joining Someone's Realm #

Joining a friend's Realm will allow you to play with them in their World. Joining a Realm is free and you do not need to purchase a Realms or Realms Plus subscription to join someone else's Realm. To join a friend's Realm, you will need the following:

- A copy of Minecraft for your device
- An Xbox gamertag
- For consoles, you will need an active subscription to your console's online service (Xbox Live, Playstation Plus, or Nintendo Switch Online)

## Joining a New Realm ##

To join a Realm for the first time, follow these instructions:

### Joining via Share Link ###

1. In Minecraft, select **Play**.
2. Select the **Friends** tab and choose **Join Realm**.
3. Enter the 6-digit invite code. If you have received a Share Link invitation, the invite code will be the last six digits of the URL.
4. Select **Join**.

### Joining via Gamertag Invite ###

1. Open the invitation.
2. Select **Join**.
3. Select **Proceed**.

### Joining a Realm on PC ##

When playing Minecraft on PC, you can also join a friend's Realm by clicking the Share Link from your friend. This will open Minecraft and add your friend's Realm to your list of Joinable Realms.

## Playing on a Joined Realm ##

Once you have joined a Realm, you can play on that Realm any time, even if the Realm owner is not playing. To play on a joined Realm, follow these instructions:

1. In Minecraft, select **Play**.
2. Select the **Friends** tab.
3. Choose the Realm you want to play on from the **Joinable Realms** list.

**Note**: If the owner of the Realm cancels their Realms subscription, removes you from the Realm, or changes the Realm world, you will not be able to play on that Realm until they invite you again.
