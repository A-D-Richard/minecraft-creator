# Minecraft and Microsoft Accounts

When playing Minecraft on Xbox, Windows 10, or Android and iOS mobile devices, you can sign in with your Microsoft Account and use your Xbox gamertag to save your progress, purchases, and play online with your friends using Realms (**Note**: you will still need to purchase an Xbox Live Gold subscription to play online on Xbox One consoles). On other devices, like Playstation 4 and Nintendo Switch, you can use a Free Microsoft Account to play.

A Free Microsoft Account will help you access your purchases, Realms, and other Minecraft content across all of your Minecraft devices. Microsoft Accounts are free to set up and use on any Minecraft device.

## Setting up a Microsoft Account

To set up a Free Microsoft Account, follow these instructions:

1.	In Minecraft, select **Sign In**.
2.	Enter the email address you want to use for your account.
3.	Enter the password you want to use for your account.
**Note**: Passwords must have at least 8 characters and contain at least two of the following: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
4.	Use the drop-downs to select your **Country/region** and set your Birthdate.
5.	Check your email for a verification code from Microsoft. Enter or paste the code and select **Next**.

Your Microsoft Account is now set up! You should be automatically signed into your account in Minecraft.

**Note**: If you are under 13 years old, you will need to get a parent's permission to complete your account set up. Please ask your parent to help you activate your Microsoft Account.

## Sign in with your Microsoft Account on Playstation

To sign into your Free Microsoft Account, follow these instructions:

4. Enter your password and click **Sign in**.

## Sign in with your Microsoft Account on Nintendo Switch

To sign into your Free Microsoft Account, follow these instructions:
