# Minecraft and Microsoft Accounts

A Microsoft Account will help you access your purchases, Realms, and other Minecraft content across all of your Minecraft devices. Microsoft Accounts are free to set up and use (Xbox users will still need to purchase Xbox Live Gold) on any Minecraft device.

## Setting up a Microsoft Account

To set up a free Microsoft Account, follow these instructions:

1.	In Minecraft, click **Settings** > **Profile**.
2.	Click Sign in for free!
3.	Enter the email address you want to use for your account.
4.	Enter the password you want to use for your account.
Note: Passwords must have at least 8 characters and contain at least two of the following: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
5.	Use the drop-downs to select your Country/region and set your Birthdate.
6.	Check your email for a verification code from Microsoft. Enter or paste the code and click Next.

Your Microsoft Account is now set up! You should be automatically signed into your account in Minecraft.

**Note**: If you are under 13 years old, you will need to get a parent's permission to complete your account set up. Please ask your parent to help you activate your Microsoft Account.


## Differences between adult, teen, and child accounts

In Minecraft, parents can set permissions for child and teen accounts for the following activities:

- Joining multiplayer games
- Receiving invitations to join other players' games
- Communicating with voice or text
- Purchasing packs or Realms/Realms Plus subscriptions
