# Purchasing and Setting Up a New Realm

Minecraft Realms are personal multiplayer servers that you can use to play with your friends. Your Minecraft Realm is always online and can always be accessed by you or anyone you invite. There are two different types of Realms subscriptions, Realms and Realms Plus.

## Purchasing a Realms or Realms Plus subscription

Subscribing to Realms or Realms Plus will give you access to one Realm. You can try Realms or Realms Plus for free for a 30-day trial. After your trial is over, you will be charged the appropriate subscription fee every 30 days.
To purchase a Minecraft Realms Plus subscription, follow these instructions:

1.	In Minecraft, click the **Settings** button and click the **Subscriptions** button. From there you can choose the **$7.99/Month** or **$3.99/Month** option
2.	Click the **Buy Now** button.
3.	Make sure to read the Terms & Conditions and the Privacy Policy and check the **I agree** box.
4.	Click the **Start Free Trial button**.


## Realms and Realms Plus

There are several key differences between a Realms and a Realms Plus subscription:

With a Realms subscription, you can:
-   Invite as many friends to your Realm as you want
-   Play online with up to two friends simultaneously
-   Keep your world active and online, even when you are not playing
-   Play on any Minecraft device
-   Let your friends play while you are away

With a 10-Player Realm (Realms Plus) subscription, you can also:
-   Play online with up to 10 friends simultaneously
-   Access a catalog of more than 100 marketplace packs that rotates monthly to provide fresh content

## What do I need to get a Realms subscription

If you are playing Minecraft on Windows 10 or an Android or iOS device, you are ready to go! If you are playing Minecraft on a console, you will need to have an active subscription to your consoleâ€™s network service:

-   Xbox Live Gold (Microsoft Xbox consoles)
-   Playstation Plus (Sony Playstation consoles)
-   Nintendo Switch Online (Nintendo Switch consoles)

You will also need to configure your device privacy settings to allow Minecraft to communicate over the Internet.

## Setting up a Realm

After you have purchased a Realms or Realms Plus subscription, you will need to set up your Realm world. You can either create a new world, or you can use one of your existing worlds on your Realm.

To create a new realm, follow these instructions:

1.	In Minecraft, click **Play**.
2.	Click the **Create New** button and then click the **Create New World** button. If you have a Realms Plus subscription, you can also choose a Realms Plus template to load. Click the template you want and click the **Download** button and then click the **Create this World!** button. 
3.	Choose the game and multiplayer settings for your new world. For more information on world settings, see this article.
4.	After you have completed adjusting your world settings, click the **Create on Realms** button.
5.	Choose the realm you want to play on. 
Note: If the realm you choose already has a world loaded, this will erase that world and any saved progress. You will also need to re-invite any friends to give them access to your new world. If you want to save your progress in this world, you can [download your world] before you create a new one.

To play an existing world on your realm, follow these instructions:

1.	In Minecraft, click **Play**.
2.	Click the **Edit** button next to the world you want to load.
3.	Adjust any game or multiplayer settings you want to change.
4.	Click the **Play on Realm** button.
5.	Choose the realm you want to play on. 
Note: If the realm you choose already has a world loaded, this will erase that world and any saved progress. You will also need to re-invite any friends to give them access to your new world. If you want to save your progress in this world, you can [download your world] before you create a new one.
