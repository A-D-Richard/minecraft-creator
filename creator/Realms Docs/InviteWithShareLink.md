# Invite a Friend Using Share Links

Share links are the best way to invite friends who play Minecraft on different devices, like iOS, Android, or Playstation. To invite a friend to play on your Realm using their a share link, follow these instructions:

1. In Minecraft, select **Play**.
2. Select the **Edit** button next to the Realm you want to invite your friend to.
3. Select the **Members** button.
4. Select the **Share link** button. Share this link with the friends you want to invite to your Realm. You can use the **Copy** button to copy the link to your clipboard or the **Share** button to share it directly via an app. **Note**: Anyone who has this share link will be able to join your realm. We recommend that you avoid sharing your link on any public places like message boards or social media profiles.
