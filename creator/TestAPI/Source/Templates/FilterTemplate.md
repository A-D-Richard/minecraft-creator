# Name of Filter

A quick summary of what the Filter does. Taken from the autogenerated docs, but can be fleshed out.

> [!NOTE]
> Please verify that the filter is still currently being used. Some filters have been phased out or have been updated. When looking for examples and you are unable to locate any, please let the creator/reader know and link to the updated filter

## Parameters

Use a table with four titles to match the autogenerated docs. If the name is a definition of an argument ,such as melee_fov, add a hyperlink to the definition.

Most filters have only one required parameter such as a Decimal, Integer or a Boolean

|Name |Default Value  |Type  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|

### Nested Table

If the table has a nested table, pull the table out as a definition, link to the table as a definition and place a snippet of the table below.

## Example

This is a custom example written by the developers/Technical writers of a fleshed out Filter using as many of the arguments available.

These can be pulled directly from the autogenerated docs.

```json
{ "test": "foo", "subject": "self", "operator": "equals", "value": true }
```
