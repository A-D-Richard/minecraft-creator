# Block Documentation - minecraft:geometry

`minecraft:geometry` is an `Identifier String` component that specifies the geometry description identifier to use to render this block. This identifier must match an existing geometry identifier in any of the currently loaded resource packs.

## Default Value of the Component

This component is specified as an `Identifier String`, so it does not have a default value. You must provide a valid geometry identifier in order to use this component.

## Example

```json
"minecraft:geometry": "geometry.custom_block"
```
