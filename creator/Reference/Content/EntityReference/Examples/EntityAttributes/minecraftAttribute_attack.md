# Entity Documentation - minecraft:attack

`minecraft:attack` defines an entity's melee attack damage and any additional effects on its attack.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> This component is *required* for an entity to attack another entity.

## Parameters

### `damage`

This can either be a single decimal value, or a range of the form `[min, max]`. When using a range, a random value is chosen between the two values for every hit. This defines how much damage is dealt when the entity attacks, measured in half-hearts.

Fractional values are always rounded down, and values below 0 are treated as 0. Attacks that deal 0 damage still cause knockback, but don't reduce the target's health. Defaults to 0.

### `effect_name` and `effect_duration`

These two optional fields define a status effect that should be applied to the target when the entity attacks it. Both must be used together to work properly.

* `effect_name`: The string identifier of the status effect to add. These are the same as used in the `/effect` command.
* `effect_duration`: The amount of time in seconds the effect should last. This allows for fractional numbers. For example, instant effects should be set to 0.05 seconds (one tick).

It is impossible to control other properties of the effect, such as the amplifier; the effect will always be level I with particles visible.

## Example

```json
"minecraft:attack": {
    "damage": 2,
    "effect_name": "poison",
    "effect_duration": 10.0
}
```
